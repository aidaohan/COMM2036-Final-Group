                <p class="storyline-text storyline-text3">The Destined One reaches The New West, a cold mountainous region. Yellowbrow, impersonating Maitreya and armed with the "Hubris Nose" relic, dispatches Kang-Jin Star against the Destined One. After the final battle, the Destined One hits her into the Gold Cymbals and releases Zhu Bajie, (Sun Wukong's old friend)  who joins the relic quest. The Destined One kills Yellowbrow at New Thunderclap Temple. He escapes into a frozen lake. Maitreya retrieves the relic for the Destined One. The Destined One and Zhu Bajie arrive at The Webbed Hollow, where the Fourth Sister comes and helps him.</p>
                <p class="thoughts">Our Thoughts:<br>The story of YellowBrow illustrates the principle that human nature is evil, as human can become evil regardless of everything, just to pursue things that bring benefits to them. This shows the black side of human nature.</p>
