            <p class="characters-info">The Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master was among the many former enemies of Sun Wukong that were assembled by Erlang Shen to defeat and kill Wukong. He armed with his new relic, the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master exacted revenge on those that previously aided Wukong against him, severing the left and right hands of Bodhisattva Pilanpo, and easily defeating her son, the Dawnstar using the Bodhisattva's Weaver's Needle.</p>
