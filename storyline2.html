                <p class="storyline-text storyline-text2">The Chosen One reaches Yellow Wind Ridge. A nameless Headless Monk appears from time to time, singing with a sanxian. The Chosen One defeats the Yellow Wind Sage using Lingji's head to contain the "Fuming Ears" relic. The Headless Monk self-identifies as Lingji reattaches his head, and hands over the relic to the Chosen One.</p>
                <p class="thoughts">Our Thoughts:<br>There is a little animation at the end of the chapter, we think that's a message implying from Lingji, telling the Chosen one that there is difference between human and monster</p>
