            <li>The setting is very large. However, there is no map guiding players. It is very easy to get lost.</li>
            <li>Players usually miss some of the content if there is no strategy reference.</li>
            <li>The addition of Chinese-style elements enriches the cultural connotation of the game, making it not only an entertainment product, but also a carrier for the dissemination and promotion of traditional Chinese culture. The combination of traditional musical instruments and modern performance technology, and the collision of traditional folk arts and modern music styles bring a unique audio-visual experience to the game.</li>
