        <p class="characters-info">Yellow Wind Sage was one of Sun Wukong's old enemies that was previously defeated. After being spared by Bodhisattva Lingji, Yellow Wind Sage participated in the Celestial Court's attack on Sun Wukong, and was gifted Wukong's ears. With these new powers, Yellow Wind Sage took revenge and decapitated Bodhisattva Lingji before taking his rat guais back to retake Yellow Wind Ridge. </p>
