                <p class="storyline-text storyline-text5">They soon encounter someone claiming to be the Bull King and Princess Fair Fox's daughter, Pingping. He instantly recognizes her as a disguised Red Boy. He tries to give the "Grieved Body" relic to the Destined One, faking a loss but secretly taking it for his powers. After being defeated by the Destined One and Zhu Bajie, Red Boy's mother Rakshasi uses her Plantain Fan to beg for his mercy. However, he refuses and takes his own life, which makes the relic reappear again.</p>
